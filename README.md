# 16-Byte-SRAM

A 16-byte SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) is a type of volatile memory that retains data as long as it is powered. The main characteristic of SRAM is that it uses memory cells made of logic gates. Each
SRAM memory cell typically consists of logic gates configured to create a latch, which can store one bit of information (0 or 1). A 16-byte memory means we have 128 bits (16 bytes * 8 bits/byte). Therefore,
128 memory cells are required. Logic gates are used to build control circuits to read and write data. Each memory cell is connected to bit lines and word lines. The word lines select the memory cell, while
the bit lines provide the data to be read or written. The design of SRAM memory cells involves using logic gates to keep the data stable without needing constant refreshing, unlike DRAM.
